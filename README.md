## Decisions

- Used [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) for the API communication
- Used `select` in the query params to get only the required data to render on the screen, omitted other fields in the response.
- [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) provides search with pagination, I have leverage the same mechanisms
- Decided to show the description of the product, as it helps to enhance the UI look & feel.
- Used [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) instead of CRA.
- Used AntDesign Breadcrumb for easy navigation
- Used AntDesign Modal, Carousel, Pagination, Tooltip and Loading UI
- [DummyJSON](https://dummyjson.com/) doesn't support search for the products under category, it supports the search for all the products
